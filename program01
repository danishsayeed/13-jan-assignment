// Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to
// calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are :
// 1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
// 2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
// 3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
// Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.
